As a Makers student
So that I can only post results I am involved in,
I need a way to log in.

As someone who's results have been posted by someone else,
So that I can make sure they are accurate,
I need a way to confirm the results.

As a slack user who plays ping pong
So that I can show everyone how great I am
I would like the leaderboard to posted to slack when I enter results.
